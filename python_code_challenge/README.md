# H3 Python Code Challenge

* Tayo and Sola want to get married. Tayo makes about X amount of Naira (the user needs to determine    this) each month and he has been diligent and       saved 25% of this salary every month,for the past 5 years.
* Sola is a contractor and thus does not have a steady flow of income. However she charges Y amount of Naira per project and gets about 9 projects a        year. She has been working for 2 years now and saves 35% of her income religiously.
* Now the couple want to start their marriage strong financially and thus book an appointment with you, a Financial advisor.

* After asking them a few questions, you understand that their goals within the next year is to:
1. Have a nice wedding
2. Rent a nice home after the wedding
3. Have 20% amount of money they currently have saved up in the bank after both heavy expenses.

* What this couple needs is a budget plan and as a financial advisor, you decide to write some lines of code (a program), that would help them and every    other couple after them stay in budget.

* Your code should:
1. Ask Tayo how much he makes monthly and then determine how much he has saved (after 5 years of working)
2. Ask Sola how much she charges per project and then determine how much she has saved. (after 2 years of working)
3. determine their total budget?
4. What is their budget for the wedding, if their rent would cost 2 million Naira a year and they are stern on having 20% of their current savings left.

5. Now Mummy sola is a Lagos big woman and wants her only daughter to have an extravagant wedding.
* She proceeds to write a list of how much things will cost for the wedding she wants to have and the total cost of the wedding is 7,150,000
* Based on this wedding cost, write some lines of code that lets the couple know if it is over their budget or not.
* Now suppose Sola's last name is Thomas and Tayo's last name is Ajayi. The Thompson's will wear color blue aso ebi
* The Ajayi's will wear color White aso ebi, and every body else will wear green.
* The Blue aso ebi cost 45,000 Naira
* The White aso ebi cost 50,000 Naira 
* The Green aso ebi will cost 40,000 Naira

**Now given this VIP invitation list**
6. Write a program that would determine the cost of Aso-Ebi for the Thomas', cost of Aso-Ebi for the Ajayi's and cost of Aso-Ebi for every one else.
